            Hello! My name is Chenyi Zhao and I'm from Fremont, CA. I'm a 3rd
            year Computer Science major and I'm doing a math minor.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was younger, I used to get yelled at pretty frequently for
            playing too much video games. And to retaliate, I really thought,
            "If it's my job, you can't do anything about it." That would be one
            of the 99 reasons I went into CS.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently taking CSC 466, CSC 430, and Math 334. There are still
            so many courses that seem so interesting, so I have no idea what
            direction I'm going in right now. If you have any recommendations
            for classes, please let me know!

              I won 2nd place at a Girls Nationals and met a World Champion,
              Gary Kasparov

              This was at 2015 PanAm in Colombia, where I won bronze and
              obtained the title WCM

            One thing that really shaped my life was chess. I actually started
            to play chess when I was about 3 years-old while I was in China.
            After moving to California, I moved in with my mother and met my
            step-father for the first time. He asked to play a game with me and
            he lost within 10 moves. He was so shocked, because he thought he
            was decent.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was then taken to the nearest chess club, and from there I was
            learning chess professionally. I took chess lessons at 7 in the
            morning daily, I had more chess homework than I had school work,
            then I traveled to 11 different countries (some I went to multiple
            times, like Brazil and Peru multiple times) to compete in
            tournaments. I met so many people and experienced so much pressure I
            do feel like I matured more than any other kid my age
          </p>
          <p>
            People do say, "It's just a game," but to me it was more than that.
            There's so many openings, strategies, and techniques that you can
            learn. There's midgame theory, endgame theory, and so much more. I
            have spent an hour on just one move, because it's like a
            never-ending puzzle with unlimited possibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            I genuinely think I wouldn't be majoring in computer science if I
            didn't play chess.
