            Hello! My name is Chenyi Zhao and I'm from Fremont, CA. I'm a
            3rd-year Computer Science major with a math minor.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was younger, I used to get yelled at pretty frequently for
            playing too much video games. And to retaliate, I thought, "If it's
            my job, you can't do anything about it." That's one of the 99
            reasons I went into CS.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently taking CSC 466, CSC 430, and Math 334. There are still
            so many interesting courses, so I have no idea what direction I'm
            going in yet. If you have any recommendations for classes, please
            let me know!

              I won 2nd place at a Girls Nationals and met a World Champion,
              Gary Kasparov

              This was at 2015 PanAm in Colombia, where I won bronze and
              obtained the title Woman Candidate Master (WCM).

            One thing that really shaped my life was chess. I actually started
            playing chess when I was about 3 years-old. After moving to
            California from China when I was 6, I met my step-father for the
            first time when I moved in with my mother. He asked to play a game
            with me, and he lost within 10 moves.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, I was taken to the nearest chess club, and from there, I
            began learning chess professionally. I had chess lessons every day
            at 7 in the morning, more chess homework than schoolwork, and
            traveled to 12 states and 11 countries (some multiple times, like
            Brazil and Peru) to compete in tournaments. I met so many people and
            experienced so much pressure that I feel like I matured faster than
            other kids my age.
          </p>
          <p>
            People often say, "It's just a game," but to me, it was more than that.
            There are so many openings, strategies, and techniques to
            learn. There's midgame theory, endgame theory, positional theory, and so much more. 
            I've spent an hour on just one move because chess feels like a never-ending puzzle with unlimited possibilities.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
            I genuinely think I wouldn't be majoring in computer science if I
            hadn't play chess.
